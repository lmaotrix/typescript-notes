## Let vs Const: When to use each?

- Let is used to declare a variable that we want to use, change, or work with
		ex.  ``` let VariableName: type = value;```
- **Interesting fact**: your IDE will only suggest methods related to the type chosen for the variable when using dot notation
		ex. ``` let name: string = "Gianluca";
			name.method()``` where method is useable for the given type!

	- if you mispell the name of the method the IDE will give you an error suggesting the correct method name
